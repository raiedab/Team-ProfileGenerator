# Team-ProfileGenerator

## By Raied Abdelgani

# Usage

## This application enables a manager to generate a webpage directory that includes the employee ID, email address, and role of each team member. Depending on the employee's role, additional relevant information is also included. The email links are clickable and will initiate a new email, and the Github usernames are clickable and will open a link to that engineer's Github profile page.
